# cs140-final-project
The final project for CS 140

Things left to do:
  - Fix the 6 InstructionTester errors
  - In qsort line 35 causes IndexOutOfBoundsException but it is supposed to run without any errors
  - 102rt.pexe causes "Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.nio.BufferUnderflowException"
  - Clear and reload buttons don't really do anything

Things to ask:
  - Ask Shawn about 11e.pasm if Data isn't in uppercase is it still separator
  - For 24e.pasm we are right with the extra errors
  - Should "Data" still be considered a separator?
